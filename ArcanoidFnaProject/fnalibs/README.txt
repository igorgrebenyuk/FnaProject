This is fnalibs, an archive containing the native libraries used by FNA.

These are the folders included:

- x86: 32-bit Windows
- x64: 64-bit Windows
- lib64: Linux (64-bit only)
- libaarch64: Linux ARM (64-bit only)
- D3D12: Agility SDK (64-bit)

The library dependency list is as follows:

- SDL3, used as the platform layer
- FNA3D, used in the Graphics namespace
- FAudio, used in the Audio/Media namespaces
- libtheorafile, only used for VideoPlayer

For Linux, the minimum OS requirement is glibc 2.31.

For the Agility SDK, be sure to put the D3D12 folder next to your game exe, and
be sure to preserve the D3D12 folder, things break badly otherwise! You will
also want to be sure that the D3D12 folder and FNA3D.dll files remain sync'd, as
the SDK is very particular about keeping the version number locked in.
